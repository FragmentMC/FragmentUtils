### Donations

If you have some spare money and like what I made, I would appreciate it if you left me a few bucks. I spent a hours on
end making this mod and it is important to me not to lock any features behind a paywall.

### Capes

Since I want to give something back to people who donate to me, and I want people to be able to show their support, if
you are a donor you are eligible to receive a cape visible to other Fragment Utils users. Note that the minimum donation
to be eligible is 5USD (at once) to prevent spam.

- Choose between "Lightning" and "Magma" cape
- Every FragmentUtils user can see your cape, even if you are not currently using the mod
- Capes include custom elytra texture
